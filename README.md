# swarm_behavior_model
Using viscek active matter ODEs to model the swarm behavior of birds. In this iteration of my project, there are what I call "Ghost birds". These birds move on a specific path and aren't affected by the other birds on screen. They do, however, act upon all other birds. That is using a modified Viscek model. The model works by calculating an individual bird's change in direction based upon the average direction (the sum of angles) of the birds in a neighboring circle around them. In my model, there are added elements of inertia and noise (both discrete and stochastic) which replicate patterns in real life (i.e, wind, reaction time, friction of medium, etc.).

To visualize the behavior of the group of birds as a whole, my program keeps track of the average direction and velocity of the flock. It is then visualized by graphing in a radial coordinate system, which better portrays the change in variables of the flock over a regular Cartesian system. This portion uses some basic ideas from a complex analysis course I've taken.
